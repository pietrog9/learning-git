# Git Basics

* git init - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* git status - shows current status [of git repository?]
* git add - adds file(s) to staging area, to be committed
* git commit - commits the version in the staging area to the repository
* git diff - shows differences between versions - the syntax is "git 
diff HEAD~1", where the 1 is the version you want to comapre to current 
version.
